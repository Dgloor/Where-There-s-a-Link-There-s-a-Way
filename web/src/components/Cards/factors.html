        A negative effect was observed for the stability of CoV-19 virus against
        rise in temperature. Therefore, countries such as India, having hot and
        humid climate, might be getting its advantage to have low infection and
        death rate as compared to other cold climate countries.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this context, pollution and unhygienic levels in many ecosystems
        under dominant activities of humans (including urbanization, fossil fuel
        exhaustion, industrialization and discharges of its effluents to water
        bodies) are beyond the limit.

        Viability of CoV-19 virus found to have a lot of correlation with
        aquatic and terrestrial environmental parameters such as pH, surface
        type, temperature etc. Air pollution is found to increase the risk of
        COVID-19 infection, therefore, use of mask and alcohols based standard
        sterilisers is strongly recommended. However, the self-revival rate of
        nature shall continue during the post-lockdown period and a master plan
        must be adapted by national and international (mostly political) bodies
        to revive Mother Nature completely.
